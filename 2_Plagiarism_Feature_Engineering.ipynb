This task will be broken down into a few discrete steps:\n\n* Clean and pre-process the data.\n* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.\n* Select \"good\" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.\n* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.\n\nIn the _next_ notebook, Notebook 3, you'll use the features and `.csv` files you create in _this_ notebook to train a binary classification model in a SageMaker notebook instance.\n\nYou'll be defining a few different similarity features, as outlined in [this paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf), which should help you build a robust plagiarism detector!\n\nTo complete this notebook, you'll have to complete all given exercises and answer all the questions in this notebook.\n> All your tasks will be clearly labeled **EXERCISE** and questions as **QUESTION**.\n\nIt will be up to you to decide on the features to include in your final training and test data.\n\n---","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-c0867615-ce7c-4844-988e-4b2d25025951"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Read in the Data\n\nThe cell below will download the necessary, project data and extract the files into the folder `data/`.\n\nThis data is a slightly modified version of a dataset created by Paul Clough (Information Studies) and Mark Stevenson (Computer Science), at the University of Sheffield.

Plagiarized categories: `cut`, `light`, and `heavy`.**\n* These categories represent different levels of plagiarized answer texts. `cut` answers copy directly from a source text, `light` answers are based on the source text but include some light rephrasing, and `heavy` answers are based on the source text, but *heavily* rephrased (and will likely be the most challenging kind of plagiarism to detect).\n     \n**2.

At it's heart, this task is a comparison text; one that looks at a given answer and a source text, compares them and predicts whether an answer has plagiarized from the source. To effectively do this comparison, and train a classifier we'll need to do a few more things: pre-process all of our text data and prepare the text files (in this case, the 95 answer files and 5 original source files) to be easily compared, and split our data into a `train` and `test` set that can be used to train a classifier and evaluate it, respectively. \n\nTo this end, you've been provided code that adds  additional information to your `transformed_df` from above. The next two cells need not be changed; they add two additional columns to the `transformed_df`:\n\n1. A `Text` column; this holds all the lowercase text for a `File`, with extraneous punctuation removed.\n2. A `Datatype` column; this is a string value `train`, `test`, or `orig` that labels a data point as part of our train or test set\n\nThe details of how these additional columns are created can be found in the `helpers.py` file in the project directory. You're encouraged to read through that file to see exactly how text is processed and how data is split.\n\nRun the cells below to get a `complete_df` that has all the information you need to proceed

The similarity features you will use are informed by [this paper on plagiarism detection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf). \n> In this paper, researchers created features called **containment** and **longest common subsequence**. \n\nUsing these features as input, you will train a model to distinguish between plagiarized and not-plagiarized text files.\n\n## Feature Engineering\n\nLet's talk a bit more about the features we want to include in a plagiarism detection model and how to calculate such features. In the following explanations, I'll refer to a submitted text file as a **Student Answer Text (A)** and the original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Source Text (S)**.\n\n### Containment\n\nYour first task will be to create **containment features**. To understand containment, let's first revisit a definition of [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). An *n-gram* is a sequential word grouping. For example, in a line like \"bayes rule gives us a way to combine prior knowledge with new information,\" a 1-gram is just one word, like \"bayes.\" A 2-gram might be \"bayes rule\" and a 3-gram might be \"combine prior knowledge.\"\n\n> Containment is defined as the **intersection** of the n-gram word count of the Wikipedia Source Text (S) with the n-gram word count of the Student  Answer Text (S) *divided* by the n-gram word count of the Student Answer Text.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n\nIf the two texts have no n-grams in common, the containment will be 0, but if _all_ their n-grams intersect then the containment will be 1. Intuitively, you can see how having longer n-gram's in common, might be an indication of cut-and-paste plagiarism. In this project, it will be up to you to decide on the appropriate `n` or several `n`'s to use in your final model.\n\n### EXERCISE: Create containment features\n\nGiven the `complete_df` that you've created, you should have all the information you need to compare any Student  Answer Text (A) with its appropriate Wikipedia Source Text (S). An answer for task A should be compared to the source text for task A, just as answers to tasks B, C, D, and E should be compared to the corresponding original source text.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll complete the function, `calculate_containment` which calculates containment based upon the following parameters:\n* A given DataFrame, `df` (which is assumed to be the `complete_df` from above)\n* An `answer_filename`, such as 'g0pB_taskd.txt' \n* An n-gram length, `n`\n\n### Containment calculation\n\nThe general steps to complete this function are as follows:\n1. From *all* of the text files in a given `df`, create an array of n-gram counts; it is suggested that you use a [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) for this purpose.\n2. Get the processed answer and source texts for the given `answer_filename`.\n3. Calculate the containment between an answer and source text according to the following equation.\n\n    >$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n    \n4.

Since plagiarism is a fairly complex task with varying levels, it's often useful to include other measures of similarity. The paper also discusses a feature called **longest common subsequence**.\n\n> The longest common subsequence is the longest string of words (or letters) that are *the same* between the Wikipedia Source Text (S) and the Student Answer Text (A). This value is also normalized by dividing by the total number of words (or letters) in the  Student Answer Text. \n\nIn this exercise, we'll ask you to calculate the longest common subsequence of words between two texts.\n\n### EXERCISE: Calculate the longest common subsequence\n\nComplete the function `lcs_norm_word`; this should calculate the *longest common subsequence* of words between a Student Answer Text and corresponding Wikipedia Source Text. \n\nIt may be helpful to think of this in a concrete example. A Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem may look as follows:\n* Given two texts: text A (answer text) of length n, and string S (original source text) of length m. Our goal is to produce their longest common subsequence of words: the longest sequence of words that appear left-to-right in both texts (though the words don't have to be in continuous order).\n* Consider:\n    * A = \"i think pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by google that uses a system of weights attached to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\"\n    * S = \"pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by the google internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\"\n\n* In this case, we can see that the start of each sentence of fairly similar, having overlap in the sequence of words, \"pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by\" before diverging slightly. Then we **continue moving left -to-right along both texts** until we see the next common sequence; in this case it is only one word, \"google\". Next we find \"that\" and \"a\" and finally the same ending \"to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\".\n* Below, is a clear visual of how these sequences were found, sequentially, in each text.\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/common_subseq_words.png' width=40% />\n\n* Now, those words appear in left-to-right order in each document, sequentially, and even though there are some words in between, we count this as the longest common subsequence between the two texts. \n* If I count up each word that I found in common I get the value 20. **So, LCS has length 20**. \n* Next, to normalize this value, divide by the total length of the student answer; in this example that length is only 27. **So, the function `lcs_norm_word` should return the value `20/27` or about `0.7408`.**\n\nIn this way, LCS is a great indicator of cut-and-paste plagiarism or if someone has referenced the same source text multiple times in an answer.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00026-f1315c17-64f0-4664-a986-854999100bbc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### LCS, dynamic programming\n\nIf you read through the scenario above, you can see that this algorithm depends on looking at two texts and comparing them word by word. You can solve this problem in multiple ways. First, it may be useful to `.split()` each text into lists of comma separated words to compare. Then, you can iterate through each word in the texts and compare them, adding to your value for LCS as you go. \n\nThe method I recommend for implementing an efficient LCS algorithm is: using a matrix and dynamic programming. **Dynamic programming** is all about breaking a larger problem into a smaller set of subproblems, and building up a complete result without having to repeat any subproblems. \n\nThis approach assumes that you can split up a large LCS task into a combination of smaller LCS tasks. Let's look at a simple example that compares letters:\n\n* A = \"ABCD\"\n* S = \"BD\"\n\nWe can see right away that the longest subsequence of _letters_ here is 2 (B and D are in sequence in both strings). And we can calculate this by looking at relationships between each letter in the two strings, A and S.\n\nHere, I have a matrix with the letters of A on top and the letters of S on the left side:\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_1.png' width=40% />\n\nThis starts out as a matrix that has as many columns and rows as letters in the strings S and O **+1** additional row and column, filled with zeros on the top and left sides. So, in this case, instead of a 2x4 matrix it is a 3x5.\n\nNow, we can fill this matrix up by breaking it into smaller LCS problems. For example, let's first look at the shortest substrings: the starting letter of A and S. We'll first ask, what is the Longest Common Subsequence between these two letters \"A\" and \"B\"? \n\n**Here, the answer is zero and we fill in the corresponding grid cell with that value.**\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_2.png' width=30% />\n\nThen, we ask the next question, what is the LCS between \"AB\" and \"B\"?\n\n**Here, we have a match, and can fill in the appropriate value 1**.\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_3_match.png' width=25% />\n\nIf we continue, we get to a final matrix that looks as follows, with a **2** in the bottom right corner.\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_6_complete.png' width=25% />\n\nThe final LCS will be that value **2** *normalized* by the number of n-grams in A. So, our normalized value is 2/4 = **0.5**.\n\n### The matrix rules\n\nOne thing to notice here is that, you can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on top and to the left of it, or on the diagonal/top-left. The rules are as follows:\n* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.\n* As you traverse your string:\n    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, in our case, when we found a matching B-B, we added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.\n    * If there is not a match, take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.\n\n<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_rules.png' width=50% />\n\nAfter completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value**.\n\nThis matrix treatment can be applied to a set of words instead of letters. Your function should apply this to the words in two texts and return the normalized LCS value.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00027-522240d2-9577-41a9-95ce-cf243cb8c21f"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"cell_id":"00028-cb67b12c-f561-4486-9461-aa266278f930"},"source":"# Compute the normalized LCS given an answer text and a source text\ndef lcs_norm_word(answer_text, source_text):\n   '''Computes the longest common subsequence of words in two texts; returns a normalized value.\n      :param answer_text: The pre-processed text for an answer text\n      :param source_text: The pre-processed text for an answer's associated source text\n      :return: A normalized LCS value'''\n\n   # extract the individual words from the given texts\n   answer_words = answer_text.split()\n   source_words = source_text.split()\n\n   # print(answer_words, source_words, sep='\\n')\n\n   # initialize a matrix of dimensions answer_words+1 × source_words+1\n   # +1 is for the first row and the first column which are intended to be 0\n   lcs_matrix = [[0]*(len(answer_words)+1) for _ in range(len(source_words)+1)]\n\n   # calculate the matrix for lcs\n   for i in range(1,len(lcs_matrix)):\n      for j in range(1,len(lcs_matrix[0])):\n         # print(i,j)\n         if answer_words[j-1] == source_words[i-1]:\n            lcs_matrix[i][j] = 1 + lcs_matrix[i-1][j-1]\n         \n         else:\n            lcs_matrix[i][j] = max(lcs_matrix[i-1][j], lcs_matrix[i][j-1])\n\n   # the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value\n   # to normalize this value, divide by the total length of the student answer\n   return lcs_matrix[-1][-1] / len(answer_words)","execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Test cells\n\nLet's start by testing out your code on the example given in the initial description.\n\nIn the below cell, we have specified strings A (answer text) and S (original source text).

***too*** **highly-correlated** with each other to include both features in a single model. For this analysis, you can use the *entire* dataset due to the small sample size we have. \n\nAll of our features try to measure the similarity between two texts. Since our features are designed to measure similarity, it is expected that these features will be highly-correlated. Many classification models, for example a Naive Bayes classifier, rely on the assumption that features are *not* highly correlated; highly-correlated features may over-inflate the importance of a single feature. \n\nSo, you'll want to choose your features based on which pairings have the lowest correlation. These correlation values range between 0 and 1; from low to high correlation, and are displayed in a [correlation matrix](https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-correlation-matrix/),
